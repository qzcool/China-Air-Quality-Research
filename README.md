# China-Air-Quality-Research
The purpose of this project is to figure out whether the air quality in China has been better in the recent years, as we were told by the government offcials.

This research is made possible by the Mission China air quality monitoring program, which includes the data portal www.stateair.net.

Data Wrangling Process:
1. Trim the missing and invalid value of the PM2.5 data in column 9 of the original data sets
2. Convert the ascii csv file in utf-8 csv file in MS Excel
